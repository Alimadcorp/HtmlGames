# HTMLGAMES

## Intro

This project is made for the [Midnight Hackathon](https://midnight.hackclub.com/) from Hack Club.

This game is a submission to r/badUIBattles and a project for the HackClub Midnight program. Basically there's a bunch of stupid questions and UI decisions that is meant to liek drive the user crazy. Also the signup form is impossible to complete, hence login is not allowed. The app is sure that no account exists already.
